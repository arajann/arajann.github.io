## Information

Welcome to my personal homepage! I recently graduated from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health with a MPH in Biostatistics and Data Science. I am looking to further build my foundations in statistical methods, data analytics, and design analysis in the realm of public health and clinical research. Within this webpage you will be able to navigate to my CV, completed studies, and ongoing projects. At the top right you can use the tabs to get to my github account, professional networks, and my email.
